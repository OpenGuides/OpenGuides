        Require CGI::Wiki 0.32 to avoid bug (again a Bob find!) where
          committing a node with metadata but no content would die.
        Auto-created category/locale stub pages now added to Category Category
          or Category Locales as appropriate.

        Fixed supersearch.cgi so it works with MySQL as well as Postgres
          (thanks again to Bob for finding the bug).

0.05    2 May 2003
        Redid the script and template installation so the script does
          actually get called what you said it should be (code copied
          somewhat from Siesta::Build).
        Fixed the support for non-local databases/IDENT authentication.
          I think.
        Fixed the hardcoded 'wiki.cgi' in some of the templates (thanks Bob).

0.04    29 April 2003
        First public release.
