0.16    
        Fixed edit conflict up so it works nicely when you click the
        Save button as well as the Preview one.

        Added preferences option of displaying lat/long as deg-min-sec
        instead of decimal (requested by James).

0.15    18 May 2003
        Added Algorithm::Diff version dependency to prereqs, fixed bug
        with preferences.cgi and blank script_name, fixed REDIRECT bug.

0.14    17 May 2003
        Added "Wanted Pages" link to navbar, thanks to Simon Cozens for
        the idea.

        Fixed many bugs noticed by Dominic Hargreaves and other Oxonians.
        Many thanks to Dominic for making an Oxford OpenGuides install for
        us to find bugs in.

0.13    17 May 2003
        Added some more stylesheet hooks.
        Tweaked OpenGuides::Diff to make it testable, added a start at tests.
        Lat and long now stored to only 6dp instead of millions.
        Added edit field for map link.

0.12    14 May 2003
        Added OpenGuides::CGI to manage cookies and things, used this to
        do more code tidying.  Added edit box position option to preferences.

0.11    14 May 2003
        Added newpage.cgi for an easy way to create new pages.

        Took loads of repeated code (for extracting and packaging metadata
        variables) out of wiki.cgi into OpenGuides::Template.

0.10    11 May 2003
        Added OpenGuides::Diff to provide nice diff output between
        node versions.

        Added OpenGuides::Template to handle Template Toolkit stuff in a
        more testable and reusable way than just bunging it in wiki.cgi

0.09    10 May 2003
        Added OpenGuides::UK::PubCrawl and pubcrawl.cgi as a start at a
        pub crawl generator.

        Added OpenGuides::Utils to make it easier to write little standalone
        scripts like supersearch.cgi, pubcrawl. cgi, etc.  Made wiki.cgi and
        supersearch.cgi use it, and lost loads of duplicated code in the
        process, hurrah.

0.08    3 May 2003

        Added fuzzy matching capability -
            action=index;index_type=fuzzy_title_match;index_value=hollborne
        Someone needs to write a nice search box interface for this.

        Fixed edit_conflict template and preview method to cope with stale
        checksum - passes through all the metadata properly now and offers
        a side by side comparison of what you input and what is stored.

        RDF output for node is now encoding-agnostic (used to have UTF-8
        hardcoded).  Also is now called as wiki.cgi?id=Node_Name;format=rdf

0.07    3 May 2003

        Require CGI::Wiki 0.32 to avoid bug (again a Bob find!) where
        committing a node with metadata but no content would die.

        Auto-created category/locale stub pages now added to Category Category
        or Category Locales as appropriate.

        Added a couple of extra allowed HTML tags to cater for existing
        grubstreet data.

        Fixed bug in OpenGuides::RDF - it used to die if called on a
        nonexistent node, now it returns stuff with a wiki:version of 0.

0.06    2 May 2003

        Fixed supersearch.cgi so it works with MySQL as well as Postgres
        (thanks again to Bob for finding the bug).

0.05    2 May 2003

        Redid the script and template installation so the script does
        actually get called what you said it should be (code copied
        somewhat from Siesta::Build).

        Fixed the support for non-local databases/IDENT authentication.
        I think.

        Fixed the hardcoded 'wiki.cgi' in some of the templates (thanks Bob).

0.04    29 April 2003
        First public release.
