NAME
    OpenGuides - A complete web application for managing a
    collaboratively-written guide to a city or town.

DESCRIPTION
    The OpenGuides software provides the framework for a
    collaboratively-written city guide. It is similar to a wiki but provides
    somewhat more structured data storage allowing you to annotate wiki
    pages with information such as category, location, and much more. It
    provides searching facilities including "find me everything within a
    certain distance of this place". Every page includes a link to a
    machine-readable (RDF) version of the page.

BUGS AND CAVEATS
