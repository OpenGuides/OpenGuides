OpenGuides Troubleshooting Guide
================================

If you wish to install the OpenGuides modules in a private directory,
the Module::Build incantation for this is

  perl Build.PL install_path=lib=/path/to/my/modules/   # version 0.20 of M::B

  perl Build.PL config='sitelib=/path/to/my/modules/'   # version 0.18 of M::B

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If any or all of the modules required by the OpenGuides scripts are in
a private directory, then you'll need to tell the scripts where to find
them.  The only way I can see to do this is to install everything and
then manually edit the scripts wiki.cgi (or whatever you called it).
supersearch.cgi and preferences.cgi to include a line something like

  use lib qw( /path/to/my/modules/ );

at the top of the scripts before any other modules are required.

If you see the following message in your webserver error logs:

  "Unable to tie -map_name [...] datafiles directory [...] does not exist
   and cannot be created."

This means that the directory you specified in your configuration as
"indexing_directory" does not exist and cannot be created by the user
that your CGI is running as.  This might mean one of two things:

 - you've specified an indexing_directory within your own webspace but
   your CGIs are running not as you but as a dedicated webserver user
   such as 'nobody' or 'www-data'

or

 - you've specified an indexing_directory in a place that you're not
   allowed to write to

or a combination of both.  Your ISP or sysadmin might be able to help you
further with this problem if you can't figure it out yourself.
