        Require CGI::Wiki 0.32 to avoid bug (again a Bob find!) where
          committing a node with metadata but no content would die.
        Auto-created category/locale stub pages now added to Category Category
          or Category Locales as appropriate.
        Added a couple of extra allowed HTML tags to cater for existing
          grubstreet data.
        Fixed bug in OpenGuides::RDF - it used to die if called on a
          nonexistent node, now it returns stuff with a wiki:version of 0.

        Fixed supersearch.cgi so it works with MySQL as well as Postgres
          (thanks again to Bob for finding the bug).

        Redid the script and template installation so the script does
          actually get called what you said it should be (code copied
          somewhat from Siesta::Build).
        Fixed the support for non-local databases/IDENT authentication.
          I think.
        Fixed the hardcoded 'wiki.cgi' in some of the templates (thanks Bob).
