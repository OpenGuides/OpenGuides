0.60    The edit form now uses stylable <div>s rather than tables.  You will
        probably want to provide at least basic styling for these.

0.59    Some CSS was altered; you should check and update your stylesheets.
        See README.CSS for details.
        Common categories and locales were moved within the navbar

0.58    No major changes

0.57    Search::InvertedIndex is deprecated; please use Plucene instead.

0.55    Wiki::Toolkit required instead of CGI::Wiki.

0.52    supersearch.cgi is now just search.cgi, so please update templates
        as appropriate, and consider adding an HTTP redirect to keep old
        links working.
