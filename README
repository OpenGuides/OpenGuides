About OpenGuides
================


**** THIS SOFTWARE IS VERY ALPHA.  It is released solely for those who ****
****     know what they're doing and want to play around with it.      ****


The OpenGuides software provides the framework for a collaboratively-written
city guide.  It is similar to a wiki but provides somewhat more structured
data storage allowing you to annotate wiki pages with information such as
category, location, and much more.  It provides searching facilities
including "find me everything within a certain distance of this place".
Every page includes a link to a machine-readable (RDF) version of the page.

At the moment, the location data uses a United-Kingdom-specific module,
so the location features might not work so well outside the UK.
