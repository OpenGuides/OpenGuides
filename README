OpenGuides Version ?.??
=======================

This module is for installing the OpenGuides wiki software. Note that it
uses Module::Build, which is a major prerequisite to installation. This
is website software, hence requires a webserver such as Apache to be 
available on the host you are installing onto. The installation also
requires a Postgres database to be available, with the user ID and password
that the site will use.

Expand out the distribution, and set your working directory to be the
top level of the distribution, then execute the following commands:

perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test
perl Build install

The very first of these commands asks a number of questions regarding
the installation.

"What do you want the script to be called?"
You can call it what you like. The program is a perl script (file.pl), and
calling it a .pl will definitely work, but some may argue that this conveys
too much information to a cracker about your site - that you are running a
perl script.

"what directory should I install it in?"
At the time you come to do "Build install", you need to have write permission
to this directory. This may require a su or sudo as root, to place files in
a directory such as /usr/lib/cgi-bin/openguides/. Note: you want to put the 
file into a directory known to the webserver as containing CGI scripts.

"what URL does the install directory map to?"
Give the full http: address of the cgi-bin directory in the previous answer.

"what directory can I use to store indexes in for searching?"
You need a directory to store files used as indexes for the site. The 
webserver will need write permission to this directory.

"what's the URL of the wiki's stylesheet?"
The distribution comes supplied with a sample stylesheet for use with an
OpenGuides site. You need to install this to a place where the webserver
can see it. !!Todo!!

"what's the name of the postgres database that this site runs on?"
"and the database user that can access that database?"
"and the password that they use to access the database?"
These questions refer to the postgres database referred to at the start.

"what's the wiki called?"
This is a title which will appear at the top of every page.

"what should the home page of the wiki be called?"
"how would you describe the wiki?"
"what city is the wiki based in?"
"what country is the wiki based in?"
"contact email address for the wiki admin?"
Self explanatory.
