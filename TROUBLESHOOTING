OpenGuides Troubleshooting Guide
================================

If you see the following message in your webserver error logs:

  "Unable to tie -map_name [...] datafiles directory [...] does not exist
   and cannot be created."

This means that the directory you specified in your configuration as
"indexing_directory" does not exist and cannot be created by the user
that your CGI is running as.  This might mean one of two things:

 - you've specified an indexing_directory within your own webspace but
   your CGIs are running not as you but as a dedicated webserver user
   such as 'nobody' or 'www-data'

or

 - you've specified an indexing_directory in a place that you're not
   allowed to write to

or a combination of both.  Your ISP or sysadmin might be able to help you
further with this problem if you can't figure it out yourself.
