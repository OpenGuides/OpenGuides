        Fixed supersearch.cgi so it works with MySQL as well as Postgres
          (thanks again to Bob for finding the bug).

0.05    2 May 2003
        Redid the script and template installation so the script does
          actually get called what you said it should be (code copied
          somewhat from Siesta::Build).
        Fixed the support for non-local databases/IDENT authentication.
          I think.
        Fixed the hardcoded 'wiki.cgi' in some of the templates (thanks Bob).
