=head1 NAME

OpenGuides::Config - Handle OpenGuides configuration variables.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Does config stuff for OpenGuides.  Distributed and installed as part of
the OpenGuides project, not intended for independent installation.
This documentation is probably only useful to OpenGuides developers.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<new>

  my $config = OpenGuides::Config->new( file => "wiki.conf" );

Initialises itself from the config file specified.  Variables which
are not set in that file, and which have sensible defaults, will be
initialised as described below in ACCESSORS; others will be given a
value of C<undef>.

  my $config = OpenGuides::Config->new( vars => { dbname => "foo" } );

As above but gets variables from a supplied hashref instead.

=head1 ACCESSORS

Each of the accessors described below is read-write.  Additionally,
for each of them, there is also a read-write accessor called, for
example, C<dbname__qu>.  This will contain an English-language
question suitable for asking for a value for that variable.  You
shouldn't write to them, but this is not enforced.

The defaults mentioned below are those which are applied when
C<< ->new >> is called, to variables which are not supplied in
the config file.
