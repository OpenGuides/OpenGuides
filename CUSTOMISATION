It is not recommended that you amend the supplied templates - they
contain logic and therefore can have bugs, they may have new features
added in the future and so on.

From OpenGuides 0.41, some of the supplied templates will optionally
call out to other template fragments that you can put in
templates/custom/.  If custom templates do not exist then sensible
default wording will be used instead.

The custom templates currently supported are:

 - licence.tt
   Will be included at the top of the page editing form.

 - footer_credits.tt
   Will be included in a <div id="footer"> at the base of every page.
   You may wish to take advantage of the supplied TT variables
     - [% delete_link %]
       Will supply a link to delete the page, if and only if your
       wiki.conf has deletion turned on.
     - [% openguides_version %]
       Contains the version of OpenGuides that your site is running on.

 - banner.tt
   Will be included in a <div id="banner"> at the top of every page.
   You may wish to take advantage of the supplied TT variables
    - [% site_name %]
      Contains the value supplied in wiki.conf as the name of the site.

Requests for further custom inserts are welcomed.
