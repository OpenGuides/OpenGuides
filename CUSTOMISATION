It is not recommended that you amend the supplied templates - they
contain logic and therefore can have bugs, they may have new features
added in the future and so on.

From OpenGuides 0.41, some of the supplied templates will optionally
call out to other template fragments that you can put in a custom template
path (by default custom-templates/). If custom templates do not exist then
sensible default wording will be used instead.

The names of all custom templates will be prefixed with custom_.

The custom templates currently supported are:

 - custom_licence.tt
   Will be included at the top of the page editing form.

 - custom_footer_credits.tt
   Will be included in a <div id="footer"> at the base of every page.
   You may wish to take advantage of the supplied TT variables
     - [% delete_link %]
       Will supply a link to delete the page, if and only if your
       wiki.conf has deletion turned on.
     - [% openguides_version %]
       Contains the version of OpenGuides that your site is running on.

 - custom_banner.tt
   Will be included in a <div id="banner"> at the top of every page.
   You may wish to take advantage of the supplied TT variables
    - [% site_name %]
      Contains the value supplied in wiki.conf as the name of the site.

 - custom_node.tt
   Will be included just below the main wiki content in node.tt.

 - custom_autocreate_content.tt
   You can control the text that gets put into the content field of any
   autocreated category/locale nodes by putting it in this template.
   The following TT variables will be available to the template:
     - [% index_type %]
       e.g. "Category" - note that the first letter is capitalised
     - [% index_value %]
       e.g. "Vegan-friendly" - capitalisation just as typed in the edit form
     - [% node_name %] 
       e.g. "Category Vegan-Friendly" - the full, "official" name of the
       autocreated node

Requests for further custom inserts are welcomed.

If you include your own versions of other (non custom_) templates in
custom-templates they will override the installed files, and this may
cause you problems. We would much rather that you let us know what we could
do to make your customisations possible within custom_ templates.
